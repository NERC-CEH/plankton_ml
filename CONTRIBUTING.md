# Contributing to this project

This is a small prototype but we welcome contributions to it.

* Please create a pull request with additions or changes
* Please use a python formatter and linter to clean your code to PEP8 standard - we like `[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)` as a formatting convention
* Please contribute a test that covers your changes
* Please provide brief instructions to a reviewer about how to exercise your code

## TODO 

* add a friendly reference for relative beginners on pull requests / git workflow with a link to a Discussion where UKCEH people can come with queries
* add a reference on good style for git commit messages
* link to examples of projects with reasonable test coverage


Thank you for thinking about contributing <3
