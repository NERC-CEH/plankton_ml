# Contributing to this project

This is a small prototype but we welcome contributions to it.

* Please [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with additions or changes. 
* Please use a python formatter and linter to clean your code to PEP8 standard - we like `[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)` as a formatting convention
* Please make sure you add a test for the code that you add. If you're not familiar with tests [this might be a helpful starting point](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)
* It's considerate to provide brief instructions to a reviewer about how to run your code and what to expect.

If you've got any questions about this, we're happy to help, please reach out to the [EDS RSE team](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/rse_group/discussions)  

## TODO 

* Add links to git commit style guides, workflow outliens
* Add links to examples of projects with reasonable test coverage
