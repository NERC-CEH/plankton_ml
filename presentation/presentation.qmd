## First slide

Plankton machine learning pipelines

## Workflow - data, processing, cloud storage

![workflow, high-level](workflow.png)

## Luigi pipeline

* Simple python package similar to R's targets, originally from Spotify
* Usage from AMI and other Biodiversity projects
* Great for prototyping, probably less so for production

## Object store API 

https://github.com/NERC-CEH/object_store_api/

## Choice of models 

* Several off-the-shelf models published by Turing Inst
* One trained on CEFAS data several years ago, published through sci.vision
* Several newer ones, oriented to marine plankton, both light and heavy to run

## Image embeddings

* Image machine learning models are useful as a source of _embeddings_ 
* E.g. a vector of numbers which the model uses as input to classification
* Use of embeddings for search and retrieval is a common technique for working with Large Language Models

## Embeddings visualiser

* similarity search
* clustering (simplest K-means clustering shown)

## Image annotation

https://github.com/NERC-CEH/cyto-ML - Ezra's original work with contributions from Phil and Erica

Discussion about whether we can adapt an off-the-shelf package rather than DIY

"Seeding success" project is using Label Studio which looks great
