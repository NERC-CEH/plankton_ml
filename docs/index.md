# Plankton ML

This is a small experimental project on automating the analysis of plankton images 

* Inform related work on reproducible analytical pipelines for bioimage machine learning by grounding them in a concrete use case
* Evaluate reusable components (e.g. the Cefas plankton model from scivision) and associated trade-offs
* Evolve a shared template for similar smaller projects undertaken by members of the RSE group in the Environmental Data Service, UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology

Please see the associated Github repository which has [outline tasks in Issues](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/plankton_ml/issues) and [prototype work in pull requests](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/plankton_ml/pulls)
